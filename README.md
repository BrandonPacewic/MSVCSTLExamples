# MSVCSTLExamples

Example code showcasing some of the capability of the MSVC C++ STL

## Setup

Please note that while I will explain how to use the MSVC STL in Visual Studio, this repository does not support being
built in that way. This repository is only here for some short examples of the STL, these examples should be run in Visual Studio
outside of this repository / directory.
